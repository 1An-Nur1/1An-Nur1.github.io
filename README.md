## Now You Know

I am M A N I Fahim, graduated from KUET. I recieved my B.E. from Department of ECE. As an alltime researcher I like to research onumerous things. My main area of interests are: Computer Vision, Image Processing, Computational Photography, Deep learning, Biomedical Image Processing.During my undergradate, I was fortunate enough to work with **Professor Dr. A.B.M. Aowlad Hossain**.
